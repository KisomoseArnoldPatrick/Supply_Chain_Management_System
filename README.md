# Supply_Chain_Management_System
A supply chain management system provides a platform for monitoring information regarding processes involved in turning raw materials and components into final products and getting them to the customer.

Choose a product of your choice, which will be managed by your supply chain management system. The system should manage the process from the raw materials to when the final product reaches the retail stores.

In order to optimize production, the system should perform analytics and make the following recommendations (using machine learning):

1. **Predict future demand based on sales data**
2. **Segment customers based on purchasing patterns** in order to derive recommendations for personalization for improved customer satisfaction

The system should allow for various categories of users to log in and perform their necessary functions.

Other functions include:

1. **Chat function** between suppliers and consumers for improved support  
   _i.e., A supplier may be a raw material supplier supplying to the factory, or a factory supplying to a wholesaler, etc._
2. **Analytics** to support decision-making
3. **Inventory management**
4. **Order processing**
5. **Workforce distribution management** at different supply centres
6. **Scheduled tasks** for sending reports to various stakeholders  
   _(These reports MUST reflect what a specific stakeholder needs)_
7. **Vendor validation**:  
   Design a Java server, which checks for applications (submitted using PDF) from those who wish to become vendors. The validation includes checking data on:
   - Financial stability
   - Reputation
   - Adherence to regulatory requirements

   Itâ€™s up to you to come up with the requirements (financial stability, reputation and adherence to regulatory requirements). If one passes the validation tests using the data they submitted during the application process, the server automatically **schedules a visit to their facility** before the entity or individual is confirmed to be a vendor in the system.
