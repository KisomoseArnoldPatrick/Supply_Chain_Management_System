# Supply_Chain_Management_System-
A supply chain management system provides a platform for monitoring information regarding processes
involved in turning raw materials and components into final products and getting them to the customer.
Choose a product of your choice, which will be managed by your supply chain management system. The
system should manage the process from the raw materials to when the final product reaches the retail
stores. In order to optimize production, the system should perform analytics and make the following
recommendations (using machine learning):

Predict future demand based on sales data
Segment customers based on purchasing patterns in order to derive recommendations for
personalization for improved customer satisfaction

The system should allow for various categories of users to login and perform their necessary functions.
Other functions include:

Chat function between suppliers and consumers for improved support ie. A supplier may be a
raw material supplier, supplying to the factory, may be a factory supplying to a whole seller etc.
Analytics to support decision-making
Inventory management
Order processing
Workforce distribution management at different supply centres
Scheduled tasks for sending reports to various stakeholders (These reports MUST reflect what a
specific stakeholder needs)
Vendor validation: Design a java server, which checks for applications (submitted using PDF) from
those who wish to become vendors. The validation includes checking data on financial stability,
reputation and adherence to regulatory requirements. Its up to you to come up with the
requirements (financial stability, reputation and adherence to regulatory requirements). If one
passes the validation tests using the data they submitted during the application process, the
server automatically schedules a visit to their facility before the entity or individual is confirmed
to be a vendor in the system.
